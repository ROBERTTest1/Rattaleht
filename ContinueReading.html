        The veloheld bike shows how pure cycling can be. It was renounced of all
        unnecessary things like gear shift or excessive graphics. A short
        wheelbase, a single gear and a narrow handlebar are the only equipment
        you need to explore the city. The creators of the veloheld, among them a
        former member of the track race national team, reduce their bikes to the
        absolutely necessary parts. Furthermore they offer them in two
        minimalistic colour versions: the white-model, only contrasting by some
        black components and the black model where even the smallest nut is all
        black.

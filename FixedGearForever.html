        A fixed-gear bicycle (or fixed-wheel bicycle in British usage, commonly
        known in some places as a fixie) is a bicycle that has a drivetrain with
        no freewheel mechanism such that the pedals always will spin together
        with the rear wheel. The freewheel was developed early in the history of
        bicycle design but the fixed-gear bicycle remained the standard track
        racing design. More recently the "fixie" has become a popular
        alternative among mainly urban cyclists, offering the advantage of
        simplicity compared with the standard multi-geared bicycle.
        <br />
        <br />
        Most bicycle hubs incorporate a freewheel to allow the pedals to remain
        stationary while the bicycle is in motion, so that the rider can coast,
        i.e., ride without pedalling using forward momentum. A fixed-gear
        drivetrain has the drive sprocket (or cog) threaded or bolted directly
        to the hub of the back wheel, so that the pedals are directly coupled to
        the wheel. During acceleration, the pedal crank drives the wheel, but in
        other situations, the rear wheel can drive the pedal cranks.[2] This
        direct coupling allows a cyclist to apply a braking force with the legs
        and bodyweight, by resisting the rotation of the cranks. It also makes
        it possible to cycle backwards.
        <br />
        <br />
        As a general rule, fixed-gear bicycles are single-speed. A derailleur
        for gear selection would introduce chain slack, which would interfere
        with braking. Gear selection can, however, be accomplished with the use
        of an internally geared hub. For example, a Sturmey-Archer fixed-gear
        three-speed hub is a fixed-gear multi-speed arrangement. Most fixed-gear
        bicycles only have a front brake, and some have no brake.

        A track bicycle or track bike is a form of fixed-gear bicycle optimized
        for racing at a velodrome or at an outdoor track. Some road racing and
        club cyclists use a fixed-gear bicycle for training during the winter
        months, generally using a relatively low gear ratio, believed to help
        develop a good pedalling style. In the UK until the 1950s it was common
        for riders to use fixed-gear bicycles for time trials. The 1959 British
        25 mile time trial championship was won by Alf Engers with a competition
        record of 55 minutes 11 seconds, riding an 84-inch fixed-gear
        bicycle.The fixed-gear was also commonly used, and continues to be used
        in the end of season hill climb races in the autumn. A typical club
        men's fixed-gear machine would have been a "road/path" or "road/track"
        cycle.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the era when most riders only had one cycle, the same bike when
        stripped down and fitted with racing wheels was used for road time
        trials and track racing, and when fitted with mudguards (fenders) and a
        bag, it was used for club runs, touring and winter training. By the
        1960s, multi-gear derailleurs had become the norm and riding fixed-gear
        bicycles on the road declined over the next few decades.Recent years
        have seen renewed interest and increased popularity of fixed-gear
        cycling.
        <br />
        <br />
        In urban North America and similar areas in other Western cities,
        fixed-gear bicycles have achieved significant popularity, with the rise
        of discernible regional aesthetic preferences for finish and design
        details. Dedicated fixed-gear road bicycles are being produced in
        greater numbers by established bicycle manufacturers. They are generally
        low in price and characterized by relaxed road geometry, as opposed to
        the steep geometry of track bicycles.
